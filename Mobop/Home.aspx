        mobile phone company in the world to outsource all of its business operations 
        except marketing, sales and finance. Its network—base stations, microwave links, 
        etc.—is maintained by Ericsson, Nokia Siemens Network and Huawei, and business 
        support is provided by IBM , and transmission towers are maintained by another 
        company (Bharti Infratel Ltd. in India). Ericsson agreed for the first time to 
        be paid by the minute for installation and maintenance of their equipment rather 
        than being paid up front, which allowed Airtel to provide low call rates of 
        1/minute (US$0.02/minute). During the last financial year (2009–10), Bharti 
        negotiated for its strategic partner Alcatel-Lucent to manage the network 
        infrastructure for the tele-media business.<img align="right" alt=""
